NEMO was originally written by Joshua Barnes, Piet Hut, and Peter Teuben.

Initial development occured mostly in 1985-1987 at the Institute
for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ by these authors. Peter Teuben has
been the maintainer of NEMO since. There is also a derived version,
ZENO, in development by Joshua Barnes.

There have been many many contributions, authors are (hopefully all) 
listed in the unix manual page "man/man5/authors.5".
