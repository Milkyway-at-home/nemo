The detailed installation instructions are in the file README.install
Two scripts, AAA_SOURCE_ME and src/scripts/test_a_new_nemo_cvs, contain
fully worked out examples how to install NEMO.

Basically, the install is a sequence is that most autoconf based software
uses:

	./configure
	make install

however, make install does not actuall install the software,
but merely prints out the instructions what to do. See the
README.install for more details.
