# loose any changes in future updates.

#  Each site should really have an identification name in 'NEMOSITE';
#  could be as complicated as to include machine name via `hostname`,
#  version numbers etc. But could also be a fixed name for your site.

#  when data is generated/exported (e.g. in FITS)
