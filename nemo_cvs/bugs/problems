		NEMO upgrade June 1988: results

Before discouraging you let me list the things we did accomplish:
  - most programs have been updated for new filestruct (check intro(1NEMO))
  - most programs now have more consistent names
  - we have set up a hopefully working efficient way to communicate
	between NEMO sites, using nemo's 'news' command and
	the regular unix 'mail' We have a user 'nemo' to whom
	bugreports and small source updates for other sites should
	be sent. It sort of needs a NEMO (mail) manager to
	dequeue the spool every now-and-then. I guess every site needs
	one.
  - a perhaps still vague description how Makefiles should look like
	should appear in more formal way soon (Peter and Josh will
	look into this; there is a pre-version of this in the
	NEMO manual)
  - created two major nemo.tex files with lot's of information
	(One we already referred to as the NEMO manual, the other
	one is Twurl's prose)
  - created a new yapp_mongo.c



A few minor things need to be looked into:
  - a few programs don't have version numbers, see intro(1NEM0)
  - some man pages miss a few 'sections'
	(mostly 'AUTHOR', proper date header/foother, 'UPDATE HISTORY')
  - graphics: we have no general and efficient way to install yapp
	devices on non-SUN's. The installer has to know what he's	
	doing - I proposed a (set of) environment variables, much like
	we use NEMOPATH, to be used in the Makefiles.
	Most makefiles have 'hardcore' programmed in which yapp to
	link with.
  - new getparam.c and history, which now lives in libT.a, must be ported
	to libJ.a (Josh needs to look further down in this file
	for more details how to get it)
	<======= There is a SUN system difference at UIUC and IAS 
	<======= The current version does not handle interactive help mode
  - hackforce in library callable format, or at least something like
	I did to make it in potential(5NEMO). Peter has a hack,
	in his orbit subdir hack. 

		===============================================
	Some more specific issues:

- data history:
	If you want to use data-history (see NEMO manual),
	you have to link with libT.a before libJ.a. This
	will use my version of getparam. Josh should copy
	this stuff over to his clib.

	files are in $NEMOPATH/src/pjt/clib:
		getparam.c history.c getparam.3 history.3

	I have initparam() understand a HISTORY environment
	variable, when set to 0 it will not do any data-history.
	This is unfortunately necessary, since some programs have
	not added the get_hist() and put_hist() before the major
	filestruct-I/O is done.
		!!!! Please change this !!!!
	At the moment data history is completely useless.
	===>
	One is forced to have an
		setenv HISTORY 0
	in the .cshrc file!

	Note to Josh: As a hack, one can use csf(1NEMO) to strip
		the history, sort of opposite function
		of hisf(1NEMO). csf is not exported to NEMO it seems.


-general filestruct/snapshot question:
	In using the snapshot macros, one uses the 'body' structure
	normally, the definition of which might be the small barebody,
	(barebody.h) or the somewhat bigger vanilla one (body.h)
	For programs which use simple array operations, and need
	the 
		...
	there is a lot of gather/scatter on the input and output
	operations because one is 'forced' to use the macros.
	Also, if you really need the arrays, it is much better
	to do all the work yourself. An example of this I needed
	to do in 'snappeak' and 'stat'. See code. snappeak is
	probably the most clear case.


potential(5):
	The use of hackforce has not been merged with the IAS
	version. I have a private copy in /disk6/pjt/teuben/orbit/hack,
	it is really a shame we didn't do this one. Some day when
	Josh decides  to modify hack-force, this will keep the
	old version. I find a lacking feature that use programs
	cannot call a hackforce, one is always forces to use
	hackforce(1), and then use the hackforce'd forces. An example
	is in unbind(1). Here it is fine with me, but what about
	orbit calculations. I had a lot of fun with my hack and
	usage of potential(5).


Personal notes:

to Josh:
   getparam.3;history.3:
	I guess see above; you need the 4 files and a small
	mod  ot your makefile
	
   snapscale.1:
	I'm exporting snapscale(1NEMO) now.


   filestruct.3:
	When get_data() gets an address 0 to get things into,
	it refuses to do so, but doesn't warn the user for
	a possible future mishap. This seems indeed a good
	defense, but I guess the user needs to be told about
	this. Possibly same with put_data().

   hackforce.1:
	Could we please have the default option in the 'options' keyword
	to be "out_mass,out_phase" instead of "out_phase", since a
	snapshot with potentials and forces in general also
	needs masses (e.g. unbind, stat, I agree, they happen
	to be mine)
	Is there a reason why hackforce does not copy the time
	from input to output file?
	
   snapplot.1:
	A small mod is necessary to be able to display movies in position-
	space, i.e. the keyword 'frame=' should be able to have a
	full filename. If one tells frame to make 'frame=frame.10'
	it should create the frame file 'frame.10'. However when using
	'frame=frame' (the default to make a time-series movie) snapplot
	will start at frame.0, i.e. create frame.0, frame.1 etc.
	See my local hack of snapplot.c
	NOTE: movie can only display frame.0, frame.1, ... etc.


    mkommod.1:
        I'm almost done with Stefano's fortran program, we can then
        straight compute the tables, and put them into mkommod.
        I'll send an update a.s.a.p. - but probably not before I
        leave for Groningen. (back on July 7).



To Piet:
    newton0.1:
	did you check if the filestructure is now compatible with
	snapdiagplot(1NEMO), i.e. you had earlier

	set Snapshot
	   ...
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	tes
	set Diagnostics
        tes
	set Diagnostics
	tes
	set Snapshot
	   ...
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	tes
	..
	..


	and diagplot does (at least did) not like the a pure Diagnostics,
	always wants a Diagnostics inside a Snapshot.
	Check with Josh otherwise.
	The above example should be:

	set Snapshot
	   ...
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	tes
	set Snapshot
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	set Snapshot
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	tes
	set Snapshot
	   ...	
	   set Diagnostics
	   tes
	tes
	..
	..


to PSWisnovski:
	- vsmooth complained about missing funcion 'putstr', probably just needs
	an update for new filestruct(). Some people complained it wasn't
	working anymore.
	Peter will look into this when back in Illinois.
