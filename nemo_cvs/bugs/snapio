Many programs assume that in a multiple snapshot file, the
size of the non-first snapshots is the same, or less, than
the first one.
Especially when using programs like 'editplot', this is
not guaranteed anymore. 

many programs need proper implementation of
	get_history(instr);	
before filestruct input, and
	put_history(instr);
before output.
