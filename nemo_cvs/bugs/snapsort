To Josh:
   % snapsort junk1 junk2 -aux

   where aux is a positive arry will result in properly sorted output
   but the aux array is suddenly negative!!

Peter,
	yes, snapsort trashes the Aux variable.  To be specific, it
uses Aux(b) to store the value of the ranking function for body b,
and then sorts particles by the value of Aux.  I can't claim this
is a feature, but it is a known bug, which I will mention in the
man page.
