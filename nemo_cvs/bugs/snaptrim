Time is looked at with a timefuzz accuracy, which is hardcoded,
should be a parameter to the program if at all.
Someone with different kind of time units (step=0.0000001 tstop=0.001)
had problems extracting snapshots.

Subject: snaptrim V1.0 times bug

snaptrim version 1.0 does not interpret the 'times' keyword
correctly for a snapshot which does not have time.
My input file had time-stamps
	(undef,2,4,6,...,40)
and a request to extract 'times=20' resulted in an output
file with the the 'undef' (actually time=0) time, and the
snapshot at time=20.

Yes, if a frame does not have any time-stamp at all, snaptrim
does not check it against the specified time range.  I'll take
this into consideration, but its really not clear what exactly
snaptrim should do in such a case.  Perhaps the best solution
is to only accept frames without time-stamps if times=all.
