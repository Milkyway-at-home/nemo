Example filters can be found on:

http://voservices.net/filter/

Filenames have been modified to something a bit shorter, and extensions are .tab, not .txt

e.g. Two_Micron_All_Sky_Survey_2MASS_H.txt    ->     2MASS_H.tab
     Two_Micron_All_Sky_Survey_2MASS_J.txt           2MASS_J.tab
     Two_Micron_All_Sky_Survey_2MASS_KS.txt          2MASS_Ks.tab

     SDSS_u'.txt                                     SDSS_u.tab
