# (Template table)
# 
# Lines starting with '# ' are comments, and many table manipulation
# programs, including for example sm ('super mongo') know how to
# skip them. If your program does not, filter this table in the
# the following way:
#
#		awk '{if ($1 != "#") print $0}' 
#
# ===> Note the need for an extra space after the comment (#) symbol
#
# It is a good habit to annotate the table with column names:
#
# mass radius
0.0	0.0
0.5	1.0
1.0	2.0
2.0	5.0
