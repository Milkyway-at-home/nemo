This directory is merely for convenience; you can place packages
in here (e.g. <nemo/kernel.h> would automatically give you access to
all the kernel routines, <nemo/snapshot.h> for Nbody, <nemo/image.h>
for Images etc. They normally contain simple include or symbolic
links; this directory can also be copied/mounted in your /usr/local/include
or anything of that kind.
