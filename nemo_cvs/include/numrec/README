This directory contains a few of the essential things from Numerical
Recipes  that may be used in NEMO.

To use them:

1)  options.h must #define the NUMREC macro

2)  -I$NEMO/inc/numrec must be a switch in 'cc' to include NumRec include
    directory; we don't want you to use <numrec/file.c> but rather
    <file.c> ...
