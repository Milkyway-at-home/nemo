.TH CCDFILL 1NEMO "21 June 2009"
.SH NAME
ccdfill \- patch up the holes in an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdfill\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdfill\fP patches up the holes in an image.
.PP
Currently a simple 2-dimensional planar fit is done to the
pixel values surrounding 'bad' pixels. The size of this area
can be choosen by the user.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP\fIin_ccd\fP
Input \fIimage(3NEMO)\fP file.
No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIout_ccd\fP
Output image file.
No default.
.TP
\fBn=\fP
Number of neighbor cells at one side to use in interpolation/fit.
The total number of cells used in the fit will hence be at most
\fB4*n*(n+1)\fP
(this already excludes the central pixel, n=1 uses 8 cells, n=2 
uses 24 etc.)
[Default: \fB1\fP].
.TP
\fBbad=\fP\fIzvalue\fP
Value in the map that should be patched.
[Default: \fB0.0\fP].
.TP
\fBall=t|f\fP
Normally only bad pixels are patches. By setting \fBall=t\fP all pixels
are re-fitted with a planar fit, effectively smoothing the map.
Default: f
.TP
\fBm=\fP
Minimum number of neighbors needed to allow a fit. Normally 3 is enough,
though this tends to add to edges. 4 would be more conservative, in
which case iter>1 can be used.
Default: 4
.TP
\fBiter=\fP
Minimum number of iterations.  0 is also an allowed value, in which
case the image will just be copied unmodified.
Default: 1
.SH CAVEATS
With m=3 you will see some singular matrix warnings, and patched values
will be bogus. It is better to set m=4 for those cases.
.PP
Edge effects will occur for large values of iter, use with caution. Really 
a better bi-linear interpolation is needed. See also 
\fIccdintpol(1NEMO)\fP if your irregulaties are regular enough.
