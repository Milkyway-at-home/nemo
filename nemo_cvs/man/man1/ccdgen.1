.TH CCDGEN 1NEMO "25 January 2005"
.SH NAME
ccdgen \- create or add objects to an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdgen\fP \fBout=\fP\fIimage-file\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdgen\fP creates or modified (2D) images by 
adding simple parameterized two-dimensional objects. For arbitrary
expressions use \fIccdmath(1NEMO)\fP instead. 
.PP
An odd feature is that the objects can be added as if they are
in a "galactic" disk with given inclination and position angle. The
default is a "face-on" view. No corrections for brightness
due to inclination are made however.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input file (optional) to be added to the output file. Default: none,
map is generated.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output file, in standard \fIimage(5NEMO)\fP format. No default.     
.TP
\fBobject=\fP
Object type. Valid are flat, exp, gauss, bar, spiral, noise. See below for
an explanation and their parameters. Default: flat
.TP
\fBspar=\fP
Parameters for this object. The first parameter is often the peak 
value, and the second one a scale length. Some object have more
complex geometries and require more parameters. The meaning
of the peak value can be modified by setting \fBtotflux=t\fP
(see below). The defaults are defined per object, but
are typically 1,1...
.TP
\fBcenter=\fP
Center of object (in 0-based pixel coordinates). The lower left corner
is counted as (0,0) here. Default: mapcenter.
.TP
\fBsize=\fP
Mapsize. It is allowed to have a different size in X and Y.
.TP
\fBcell=\fP
Cellsize [1]      *not used yet*
.TP
\fBpa=\fP
Position Angle of disk in which the object lives. Counted positive
starting at North through East in the standard astronomical
fashion. Default: 0
.TP
\fBinc=\fP
Inclination Angle of disk in which object lives. 0 is face on.
Default: 0
.TP
\fBtotflux=t|f\fP
If set to true, the amplitude (always the first parameter in
\fBspar\fP) is interpreted as the total integrated intensity
instead of the peak value of the object.
Default: \fBf\fP.
.TP
\fBfactor=\fP
The factor by which an image is multiplied before the object is added.
Warning: if the amplitude (usually the first of the spar= numbers) is 0,
this will not apply, and the output would equal the input.
Default: 1
.TP
\fBcrpix=\fP
Override/Set crpix (1,1,1) 
.TP
\fBcrval=\fP
Override/Set crval (0,0,0) 
.TP
\fBcdelt=\fP
Override/Set cdelt (1,1,1) 
.TP
\fBseed=\fP
Random seed [0]    
.TP
\fBheadline=\fP
Random verbiage added to the image. Default: none

A few object that are in MIRIAD's \fIimgen(1MIRIAD)\fP program and not listed 
here directly, can be simulated or replaced by:
.nf
.ta +1i +2i
level	same as our flat
cluster	same as isothermal, except we also allow p different from -0.5
noise	notice we have a mean, miriad doesn't, also miriad has a crude low approximation
point	use exp with a very small scale length \fBh\fP
gaussian	our gauss, but bmin/bmaj via inc
gauss3	no equivalent, ccdgen does not support 3D models yet
disk	use ferrers with p=0
.fi
.PP
Most of these objects have a peak or representative intensity value as the first argument,
and a scale length as the second parameter. The next parameters are sometimes scale
free 
.PP
Bars have an additional axis ratio (we mostly use e=1-b/a here) and position angle
of the bar w.r.t. the disk in the disk plane
(see \fIsnaprotate(1NEMO)\fP for an approach if you
know the angle of the bar in the sky plane). A Ferrers bar also needs to know the
power (usuall an integer) to which 1-r^2 is raised.
.PP
Spirals are yet more complex: A and h are the usual peak and exponential scale-length.
k is the wavenumber (related to the pitch angle as tan(pitch)=1/(2.pi.k.r), 
see also \fImkspiral(1NEMO)\fP),
p controls the relative width of the spiral (assumed to be cos^p(m*phi), 
r0 the starting radius of the spiral (defaults to 0), p0 the
phase of the spiral at radius r0, and m the number of spiral arms. In particular,
since the \fIpow(3)\fP function is used internally for non-integer values of \fBp\fP,
the bahavior of \fBm\fP for integer and non-integer values of \fBp\fP is different:
for integer values our own internal \fIpowi(3NEMO)\fP is used, and correctly represents.
For example, for m=1 and p=1 you'll get a one armed spiral, but with negative counter-arm.
With p=2 it becomes a 2-armed spiral, as they will get progressively narrower as p remains
even and gets higher. For odd values of p you will again have a positive and negative
spiral, and as p gets larger, the arms get narrower.   By making sure \fBp\fP becomes
non-integer, e.g. p=2.0001, the negative arm becomes 0.

.SH EXAMPLES
Here's how to make a simple barred galaxy by adding an exponential disk and
a (smaller) exponential bar:
.nf
ccdgen out=- object=exp spar=1,40 pa=60 inc=45 size=256 |\\
 ccdgen - bar.ccd object=bar spar=10,6,0.5,70 pa=60 inc=45

.fi
or if you want them to be a bit more astronomical, you'll need to make the units
come out in degrees for the conversion to FITS, viz.:
.nf

ccdgen out=- object=exp spar=1,40/3600 pa=60 inc=45 size=256 cdelt=-1/3600,1/3600 |\\
 ccdgen - - object=bar spar=10,6/3600,0.5,70 pa=60 inc=45 |\\
 ccdfits - bar.fits radecvel=t
.fi
