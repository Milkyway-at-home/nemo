.TH CCDMOM 1NEMO "18 October 2005"
.SH NAME
ccdmom \- moment or accumulate along an axis of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBccdmom\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBccdmom\fP takes special moments (in position, or image intensity)
along an axis of an image/cube. 
It can optionally also accumulate along the selected axis.
.PP
For datacubes that need to produce velocity fields a number of
alternate options (gaussian fit, envelope tracing etc.) are available
via \fIpvtrace(1NEMO)\fP.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
Input image file. No default.
.TP
\fBout=\fP
Output image file. No default.
.TP
\fBaxis=\fP
Axis to take moment along (1=x 2=y 3=z)
[Default: \fB1\fP]
.TP
\fBmom=\fP
Moment to take [-2,-1,0,1,2,3..]    
Compute either the sum (0), mean (1), dispersion (2), or peak location (3). Negative
numbers also have a special meaning. -1 computes the average intensity along the axis,
where -2 computes the dispersion around the mean value.
[Default: \fB0\fP].
.TP
\fBkeep=t|f\fP
Boolean value if to keep the moment axis. If you keep the axis (instead
of compressing it), the values are replaced with the computed moment.
This can be useful if you want to subtract an cube/image with the
mean value along a certain axis. Only in this case (but see also
\fBcumulative=t\fP below) will the output image have the same
shape and dimension as the input image.
[Default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBcumulative=t|f\fP
Boolean value if the values should accumulate instead along the selected axis. 
The \fBmom=\fP keyword is ignored, and the input and output datasets will
now have the same shape and dimension. 
[Default: \fBf\fP]
.SH SEE ALSO
pvtrace(1NEMO), ccdsub(1NEMO), image(5NEMO)
.SH CAVEATS
Cannot compute straight moments, e.g. the 2nd moment along an axis, such
as e.g. \fIsnapgrid\fP can do. This 
program only computes user friendly numbers (sum, mean, dispersion)
and gives special meaning to negative values of mom= and axis=.
