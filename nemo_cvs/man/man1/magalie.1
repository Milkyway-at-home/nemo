.SH NAME
magalie \- Boily et al. composite disk-bulge-halo model
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmagalie\fP [parameter=value]
.PP
\fBmagalie.exe\fP 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmagalie\fP creates a composite Disk-Bulge-Halo galaxy in 
near equilibrium following the procedure described in
Boily et al.(2000), adapted from Hernquist's (1993) BUILDGAL 
procedure.
This program is merely a NEMO wrapper
to Version 1 of the fortran program \fImagalie.exe\fP.
It assembles all the correct parameters, runs the fortran
namesake program in a temporary rundirectory and converts the
ascii output to a NEMO \fIsnapshot(5NEMO)\fP.
.PP
The galaxy is scaled based on the disk with mass=1 and 
(exponential) scalelength=1. In addition, a
selection of the solar radius (2.43 scale lenghts is the
current default) will fix the rotation speed at the
IAU value of 220 km/s, though the velocity is also normalized
to this value.
.PP
This NEMO frontend only controls a number of parameters, to match
the functionality of \fImkkd95(1NEMO)\fP, however there are quite
a few more options in the original program, e.g.. adding a gas disk,
satellited, individual smoothing lengths. These will be implemented
in a future release. It is easy for the user to manually create
such models those, by setting \fBcleanup=f\fP and editing the
input parameter file \fImagalie.in\fP in the temporary run directory,
and running the \fImake-it\fP shell script. Careful not to change
the number of particles, or modify the corresponding keyword
in this script.

Random seed.
[Default: 0]
.TP
\fBcleanup=t|f\fP
Cleanup runtime working directory?
[Default: t]
.TP
\fBheader=|4|8\fP
Size of the header uses in unformatted fortran data. This used to be 4,
but modern compilers (e.g. gfortran) may very well use 8. By default it
is not specified, and the value determined to be the correct one during
install (UNFIO_HDR_SIZE) is used. This keyword can be used to force
another value, for example if you have compiled magalie with another 
than the default compiler.
.SH INPUTFILE
\fBmagalie\fP calls the actual \fBmagalie.exe\fP by reading an input file
of parameters. Here is an annotated example of such a file (the comments
can be left in when read)

.SH PERFORMANCE
The bulk of the CPU is in creating the disk particles, the bulge and halo are 
a much smaller fraction of the cpu. On a 3 GHz Pentium-4 the cpu cost is
about (Ndisk/630) secs for the gnu compiler. On a 1.6 P4 laptop this
was about (Ndisk/420) secs.
.SH BUGS
There have been reported cases where magalie just seems to continue to
compute in an infinite loop.
.PP
Does not work on the linux/intel compiler yet.
