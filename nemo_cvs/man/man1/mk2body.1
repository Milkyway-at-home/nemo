.TH MK2BODY 1NEMO "7 June 2010"
.SH NAME
mk2body \- make a 2 body system
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBmk2body\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Creates initial conditions for a 2-body problem but where the main body
is initially at the origin with unit mass. Only the mass and phase space
coordinates of the 2nd body can given. 
.PP
Alternatively orbital parameters for the 2nd body can be given, though 
not  implemented yet.
