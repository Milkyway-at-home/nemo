.TH QUADINTER 1NEMO "6 May 1992"
.SH NAME
quadinter \- quadrupole-order force calculation from tabulated field.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBquadinter\fP \fBquad=\fIquad_table\fP \fBin=\fIsnapshot\fP [parameter=value] ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIquadinter\fP computes quadrupole-order forces and potentials for a set of
particules supplies in an N-body snapshot from a quad-table that must have
been prepared by \fIquadforce\fP.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBquad=\fP\fIquad_table\fP
Input file with quadrupole-order field tables. No default.
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP\fIsnapshot\fP
Input file with an N-body snapshot. No default.
.TP 20
\fBout=\fP
output file with added forces and potentials. This will be a copy
of the input \fIsnapshot\fP. Default: none.
.SH LIMITATIONS
The code has a hardcoded maximum number of particles, through the
macro \fBMBODY\fP. (currently 4096). If more are needed, it needs
to be recompiled. See comments in \fIquadcode(1NEMO)\fP
