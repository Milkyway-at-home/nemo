.TH SNAPDISK 1NEMO "3 August 2006"
.SH NAME
snapdisk \- assign rotation to a disk
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapdisk\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsnapdisk\fP assigns rotation in the XY-plane to an assumes disk
where forces have been assigned by another program (e.g. hackforce).
The rotational velocities are computed from the two-dimensional
forces and radii as follows:
.nf
      v = sqrt(\fBa.r\fP)
.fi
One can optionally also supply a known rotation curve,in tabular format,
to assign rotational velocities.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBin=\fP
input file (snapshot) [???]    
.TP
\fBout=\fP
output filename [???]     
.TP
\fBomega=\fP
rotation (counterclock) [0.0]     
.TP
\fBrotcur=\fP
Optional rotation/outflow curve (table: r,v) [] 
.TP
\fBsign=\fP
Sign of rotcur [1]    
.TP
\fBoutflow=\fP
Outflow or Rotation/Spin ** not implemented **[f]    
.TP
\fBtimes=\fP
times of snapshots to copy [all]  
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is an example of computing the rotation curve of a test disk that could
live inside a Kuijken-Dubinsky Disk-Bulge-Halo composite model. After using
\fIhackforce(1NEMO)\fP to compute the forces due to the KD95 model, snapdisk
will compute the matching rotational velocities to be in circular motion.

some options in this program are not functioning correctly yet, as it was
quickly cloned off snapspin
