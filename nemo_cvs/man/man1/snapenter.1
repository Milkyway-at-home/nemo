.TH SNAPENTER 1NEMO "24 March 1994"
.SH NAME
snapenter \- enter an N-body snapshot interactively into a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapenter\fP [\fBout=\fPsnapfile] [\fBnbody=\fPnbody]
[\fBtime=\fPtime] [\fBheadline=\fPstring]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnapenter\fP prompts for input from the screen of the basic data
describing a snapshot file: masses, positions and velocities of each
particle in an N-body system. 
The data are written into a file
\fIsnap-file\fP, in a standard N-body snapshot format. 
If not provided on the command line, \fIsnapenter\fP will prompt for
the name of \fIsnap-file\fP and \fInbody\fP, the number of particles.
.PP
To still enter snapshots interactively, but for a larger amount
of bodies, the ``205'' format (see \fIatos(1NEMO)\fP) can be used.
An ascii file with masses, positions and velocities can be created
with an editor, and \fIatos(1NEMO)\fP is used to convert this file
to a proper snapshot(5NEM0) file.
.PP
Coordinates are not transformated to the center-of-mass coordinate system,
for this the program \fIsnapcenter\fP needs to be used.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized; they may be given in any order.
.TP 25
\fBout=\fP\fIsnap-file\fP
Output data is written into \fIsnap-file\fP, in standard snapshot format.
.TP
\fBnbody=\fP\fInbody\fP
Number of particles \fInbody\fP in Nbody snapshot. 
.TP
\fBtime=\fP\fItime\fP
Time at which the snapshot applies (default: \fItime\fP=0.0).
.TP
\fBheadline=\fP\fIstring\fP
Optional headline, which is written as the first item in the snapshot
file, the next item being the snapshot itself.
.TP
\fBverbose=t|f\fP
In interactive mode you should set this to \fBtrue\fP, but in a case 
\fBsnapenter\fP was used in a pipe (see EXAMPLE below), it cuts down
a large number of messages.
[Default: \fBfalse\fP].
.SH EXAMPLE
A cleverly formatted ASCII table can also be piped into snapenter,
if they only contain masses, positions and velocities in the following
format:
.nf

  N
  m1 x1 y1 z1 vx1 vy1 vz1
  m2 x2 y2 z2 vx2 vy2 vz2
  ...
  mN xN yN zN vxN vyN vzN

.fi
where the first number, N, is the number of particles. If that is not
available in the file, specify it via the commandline.
