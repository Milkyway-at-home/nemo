.TH SNAPMSTAT 1NEMO "18 September 1990"
.SH NAME
snapmstat \- statistics of the masses in a snapshot
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapscale in=\fP\fIin_file\fP [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnapmstat\fP runs through the masses of a snapshot, in
sequential order or sorted by mass, and reports in each bin
(to be defined later) how many stars there are and the total
mass is each bin.
.PP
A new bin is defined when its predecessor in the searching 
(either sequential or sorted) has a different mass.
.PP
The output is suitable to be parsed by \fIawk(1)\fP or
\fItabmath(1NEMO)\fP and can be used in \fIsnapmask(1NEMO)\fP
to select certain particles by mass. \fIsnapcopy\fP can perhaps
also be of some use.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized:
.TP 24
\fBin=\fIin_file\fP
input file, in \fIsnapshot\fP(5NEMO) format.  Default: none.
.TP
\fBsort=\fBt|f\fP
Should masses be sorted? Although this keyword has not been
implemented yet, it's effect can be achieved with \fIsnapsort\fP.
[default: \fBf\fP].
.TP
\fBspecies=\fImaxspecies\fP
Maximum number of species allowed. This keyword is also not used,
since the current table is build on the fly, and not saved.
[default: \fB100\fP].
.SH EXAMPLE
The output of an SPH snapshot could look like:
.PP
.nf
0 0:8191  = 8192 Mass= 3.4332e-06 TotMas= 0.0281248 CumMas= 0.0281248
1 8192:12287  = 4096 Mass= 1.5259e-05 TotMas= 0.0625009 CumMas= 0.0906256
2 12288:28671  = 16384 Mass= 9.7275e-06 TotMas= .159375 CumMas= .250001
3 28672:45055  = 16384 Mass= 6.1035e-05 TotMas= .999997 CumMas= 1.25
4 45056:49151 = 4096 Mass= 0.00015259 TotMas= .625009 CumMas= 1.87501
