.TH XRANDOM 1NEMO "9 September 2001"
.SH NAME
xrandom \- Return seed for random numbers and optionally random numbers
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBxrandom\fP [parameter=value]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBxrandom\fP returns a seed that can be used to random number generators,
and optionally random numbers drawn from a uniform or gaussian (normal)
distribution. Uniform numbers are between 0 and 1, gaussian numbers 
have a mean of 0 and a dispersion of 1. 
.PP
If compiled with GSL, random number generator types 
can be selected, as well as many more distribution types.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized in any order if the keyword
is also given:
.TP 20
\fBseed=\fP
Initial seed. Use 0 for the current time (seconds since 1970.00,
see also \fItime(2)\fP)
-1 for the number of centiseconds since boot (see \fItimes(2)\fP) 
and 2 for the current pid (see \fIgetpid(2)\fP).  If GSL is implemented
the seed value can be optionally followed by the random number 
generator type (default: mt19937). See \fIxrandom(3)\fP for more
details.
\fBn=\fP
[Default: 0].
Number of random numbers to draw 
[Default: 0].
.TP
\fBgauss=\fP
Return gaussian numbers instead of uniform?
[Default: f]
.TP
\fBreport=\fP
Report mean/dispersion/skewness/kurtosis? 
[Default: f]
.TP
\fBtab=t|f\fP
Tabulate all random numbers [t]
.TP
\fBgsl=\fP
Name of the random number distribution requested. They follow the name convention
of the same-name functions \fIgsl_random_xxx\fP in the \fIgsl(3)\fP library.
No default.
.TP
\fBpars=\fP
Parameters belonging to the selected \fBgsl\fP name. They need to match
exactly (0, 1, 2 or 3 currently). No default.
.SH EXAMPLES
Here is an example script, \fBgrandom.csh\fP, 
to test if the error in the mean scales
as 1/sqrt(N):
.nf

#! /bin/csh -f
#
#       n1: sample size 
#       n2: number of times to do the experiment

set n1=100
set n2=100
foreach i (`nemoinp 1:$n2`)
  set log=(`xrandom -1 100 t | tail +2 | tabhist - tab=t |& grep ^Mean`)
  echo $log[5]
end

.fi
This script outputs \fBn2\fP numbers, of which the mean should be 0 and the
dispersion (now the error in the mean) 1/sqrt(n2), where 0 and 1 are the
mean and dispersion of a random gaussian number from \fIgrandom(3NEMO)\fP:
.nf

       % grandom.csh | tabhist -
100 values read
min and max value in column 1: [-0.335527 : 0.348629]
Number of points     : 100
Mean and dispersion  : 0.0120416 0.102367
Skewness and kurtosis: -0.0528344 1.19066
Median               : 0.000425562

.SH GSL
If the GNU Scientific Library (GSL) has been enabled during installation, the
\fBgsl=\fP and \fBpars\fP keyword will appear in the keyword list of xrandom.
The following random number distribution names are implemented, 
and the names of their parameters. Note that
the number of parameters, as given in \fBpars=\fP has to match exactly,  there are no
defaults.
