.TH GALPOT 5NEMO "8 November 2008"
.SH NAME
GalPot \- galactic potential descriptor
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIGalPot\fP potential (\fBpotname=GalPot\fP) describes the Milky Way
potential as published in Dehnen & Binney (1998). A number of standard
models have been implemented via datafiles in $NEMODAT/GalPot.
.PP
The Dehnen & Binney model contains three components: a disk, bulge and halo.
The disk is made up of three components: ISM, thin and thick stellar disk,
each of them a double (in R and |z|) exponential disk.
The bulge and halo are both parameterized flattened spheroids.
.SH "UNITS"
There are two implementations of GalPot in falcON:
.SH "UNITS-1"
Taken from falcON/src/public/acc/GalPot.cc:
.nf
The units differ from those used in class GalPot: we have

.SH "UNITS-2"
Taken from falcON/inc/acc/GalPot.h
.nf
The unit system used throughout the classes and functions defined here and 
in included files is based on the following basic units                    
	unit of length:		1 kilo parsec (kpc)                        
	unit of time:		1 mega year   (Myr)                        
 	unit of mass:		1 solar mass  (Msun)                       
This implies the following dimensions
