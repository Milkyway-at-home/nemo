.TH WCSTOOLS 5NEMO "12 July 2004"
.SH NAME
wcstools \- access sky coordinates in astronomical images and search astronomical catalogs
.SH DESCRIPTION
WCStools is a set of programs that helps manipulating images (FITS files) and catalogs,
in particular with their World Coordinate Systems (WCS). NEMO has traditionally a poor
WCS support, and interfaces with WCStools may be useful. The table below lists
a loose functional comparision between the two packages where their functionality
is close.
