.TH TRICKS 8NEMO "6 March 1989"
.SH NAME
tricks \- some tricks (and bugs) when using NEMO
.SH DESCRIPTION
One can use \fIcat(1)\fP to catenate structured binary files, e.g.
.nf
	\fBcat r001a.dat >>r001.dat\fP
.fi
.PP
To copy structured binary files between machines of different binary
format, use the \fItsf(1NEMO), rsf(1NEMO)\fP programs and, if available,
the \fIcompress(1), uncompress(1)\fP utilities:
.nf
	\fBtsf in=r001.dat maxprec=t allline=t | compress >> r001.data.Z\fP
and on the other machine:
	\fBzcat r001.data.Z | rsf - r001.dat\fP
.fi
On non-Unix supercomputers, often the ASCII
"205" format (see e.g. \fIatos(1NEMO)\fP)
will be used. This may be saved in compressed format also, and can
be processed by NEMO after
.nf
	\fBzcat r001.data.Z | atos - r001.dat\fP
.fi
.PP
Some N-body programs, which are capable of handling a series of snapshots,
and selecting them using the \fBtimes=\fP keyword, are not able to
handle subsequent snapshots which are larger than the first one. In fact, 
unpredictable things may happen, although usually it results in
a core because of illegal memory access. There are two solutions.
The program can be recompiled, by using a \fB-DREALLOC\fP flag or
\fB#define\fP it in the source code. The second solution is to prepend
the datafile with a large enough 'dummy' file.
.PP
To display a scatter diagram in the form of a contour map, convert
the two columns to a snapshot by calling them 'x' and 'y' coordinates.
Remaining phase space coordinates are unimportant. Set masses to 1, and
use the \fIatos(1NEMO)\fP format. A program like \fIawk(1)\fP can write
the file for \fIatos(1NEMO)\fP, then \fIsnapgrid(1NEMO)\fP creates a
\fIimage(5NEMO)\fP file, which can be optionally smoothed using
\fIccdsmooth(1NEMO)\fP and displayed with \fIccdplot(1NEMO)\fP. In case
your host has nicer contour plotting programs, use \fIccdfits(1NEMO)\fP
to write a \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP format file.
Check also the tabccd shell script, if available, or perhaps someone
wrote it in C already. It calls awk, atos and snapgrid.
.PP
The \fIds(1LOCAL)\fP program, written by Bill Sebok, is one of the external 
programs
which can be used to display images. \fIds\fP can understand a variety of
image file formats, of which the \fIfits(5NEMO)\fP is best suited for our needs.
Transform your image to a fits file using \fIccdfits(1NEMO)\fP, and use 
ds on that fits file. Although \fIds(1L)\fP 
works on monochrome SUN workstations,
it's best on a color monitor. The trick to remember is to use the \fB-yflip\fP
switch, or click on the Y button, because  our fits interface has a problem
obviously...
