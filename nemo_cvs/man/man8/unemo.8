.TH UNEMO 8NEMO "21 May 2001"
.SH NAME
unemo \- micro-NEMO environment
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIuNEMO\fP is an environment which gives users access to
the basic I/O library alone. A few more files are also
needed, and getparam.c is replaced by getparam_fake.c,
creating a libunemo.a to complete external linking.
.PP
Most notably, all aspects of the NEMO user interface have
been avoided, so users can use their own main(). However,
NEMO's output routines like dprintf(), error() and warning() 
are still called, and can in principle be overridden
by the users own names.
.SH CAVEAT
The include file config.h is currently located in $NEMOLIB, since
it is made by the configure system. Thus uNEMO should be built
after a regular NEMO has been built, although with some tweaking
any config.h can probably be used.
.PP
It is possible that the ZENO library is more cleanly defined in 
terms of usage by clients that don't want to use the whole NEMO
or ZENO libarry.
