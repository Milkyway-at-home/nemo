Most of the code in here is (c) Copyrighted by Numerical Recipes Software.

However, please be careful in using them; some routines have a slightly
different parameter sequence or type than their corresponding NumRec
version to make them work within the NEMO environment. Also, some 
routines do not use the #define's, but instead of control parameters.
