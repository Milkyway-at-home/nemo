To install this package:

    xmkmf
    make 
    mv libyapp_x.a $NEMOLIB
    make clean


Some historic comments:



1-nov-92: Patrick submitted code to NEMO (someplace in usr/pat)

    it seems, that 'xmkmf' does not work for this account, but this is the
    most convenient way to produce a Makefile for X applications. 
    So I cannot test my program and I have to leave it here in the 
    purely source code. I hope, all neede things are provided.

8-oct-94: tested sun4 and sun5 implementations using a makefile generated
    with xmkmf, which now appears to work in maryland.
    the testprogram yappx, as well as snapplot and snapdiagplot appear to
    work fine. Note the following YAPPLIB's that are needed:

        sun4:   setenv YAPP_X4 "-lyapp_x -lX11"
        sun5:   setenv YAPP_X5 "-lyapp_x -lX11 -lsocket -lnsl"

    e.g. on a sun5:

        make snapplot YAPPLIB="$YAPP_X5"

    should compile a version of snapplot with this yapp_x library compiled.


15-jan-94: oops, this yapp was written with 'double arguments all over the
	place. At some point, the yapp interface was defined in terms
	of 'real' ( defined in <stdinc.h>, often set by $NEMOBIN/cc)
	This meant that nearly all double's in the code could be replaced
	by real's. This to make the linux version work.

	As it stands now, the code does contain some static vs. extern
	declaration problems, which fail in pedantic gcc.
