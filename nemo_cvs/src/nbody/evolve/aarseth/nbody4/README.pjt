March 2006:
  This is the Brut4 (Nbody4 without the GRAPE routines) distribution from Sverre.
  For the original version (minus the below mentioned differences for NEMO)
  URL: ftp://ftp.ast.cam.ac.uk/pub/sverre/nbody4/brut4.tar.gz


Minor modifications for NEMO:

- data.f: the input file (unit 10 here) is now binary, as in nbody1 and nbody2
  ah... no, i keep changing my mind on this issue.....
