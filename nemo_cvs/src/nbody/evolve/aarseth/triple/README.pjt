TRIPLE: merged PGPLOT and X windows version. 
    (Peter Teuben, January 1998).

History:

  - 01-Jul-1998:    fixed bug reported by Sverre
  - 25-sep-1998:    fixed quitting bug, added sun-earth-jupiter example (sej.in)
  -  1-mar-2006:    documented the color aggressive window managers
  -  5-jul-2009:    document VNC trick

Incompatible things with Sverre's January 1998 version:

  - merge code base for pgplot and Xtc versions using a different movie.f
	ptriple comes from linking with moviep.f (+ pgplot)
	xtriple comes from linking with moviex.f (+ Xtc based files)

  - pgplot's window size is set via the PGPLOT_XW_WIDTH environment variable
    however, in Sverre's version an extra line was read that reads the size
    of the X windows plot in 'xtriple'. This has now been hardcoded in
    moviex.f (to 512), in favor of keeping the two programs symmetric. 

    A good solution would be to use X resources for this (as PGPLOT does too)
    See the ptriple.xrdb for an example of this



Not finished yet:

  - figure out difference between g77 (BENCH) and f2c (BENCH1) compiler	results

  - either use the g77/f2c compile flag "-fno-second-underscore", or hardcode
    the double underscore for g77/f2c ?
    See xmovie.c

  - merge in Sverre's last additional parameter to the first line (to control
    the delay times for the movie)


Some other things to note:

  - xtriple only works in 8 bit X windows, not in  16/24/32 bitdepth.
    It needs a fair number of colors, so better not have netscape or an 
    old version of pgplot.
    The alternative is of course to use ptriple, the pgplot based version,
    which runs just fine independant of what colordepth you are using
    in your X server.
    If you really MUST use xtriple, here are some tips on e.g. linux

	- start a 2nd X windows sessions, but using twm instead.
		
	  On linux you'll need to use ctrl-alt-F2 to open a new console, 
	  then login and start X in 8bit mode:
		startx -- :1 -depth 8
	  the syntax may however vary a bit...  
	  In order to use twm,instead of e.g. Gnome or KDE you;ll also
	  need to consult the manuals. One quick hack is to temporarely
   	  use another .xinitrc file, e.g.

               xrdb -load $HOME/.Xresources
               xsetroot -solid gray &
               xclock -g 50x50-0+0 -bw 0 &
               xload -g 50x50-50+0 -bw 0 &
               xterm -g 80x24+0+0 &
               xterm -g 80x24+0-0 &
               twm

	  and remove it after you're done. Sverre has a nice script called
	  startx8 for this.

	  twm does not use as many colors, and now xtriple will work.


    The following VNC trick should also work to get an 8 bit display:


     % vncserver :1 -depth 8 -cc 3 -geometry 1024x768
     % vncpasswd
     % vncviewer :1

    and in this new 8 bit viewer you can run your application

     % xtriple < 

     and at the end, kill the server again

      % vncserver -kill :1
