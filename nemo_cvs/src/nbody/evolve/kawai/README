These two code were added to NEMO since they show novel aspects of
writing treecode's. They were both written by Atsushi Kawai 
at U of Tokyo (now at: RIKEN). 

The directory name "kawaii" is a typo because NEMO's maintainer
has been to Hawaii a few times in recent years, and a pain to
change this in CVS :-(
  [fixed in May 2003 by patching the CVS repository]


Neither code conforms to the NEMO makefiles for installation, and you
may have to tune your makefile to get it to compile.
