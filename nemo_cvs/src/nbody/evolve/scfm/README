This version of the Self Consistent Field code has been submitted by
Lars Hernquist in July 1997. The code "second.f" may be needed on some
architectures if your fortran library does not contain it. Equally
so, the call to etime() may have to be replaced or you have to get
your own version of etime.c

Examples of timing on the benchmark: (100 steps, 1024 particles)


Pentium-333	6.93"
Pentium-500	4.58
Pentium-933	2.76    (g77 -O2)
Ultra-10/300	9.64	(g77 -O)
		7.20	(f77 -O)
		7.33	(f77 -fast)
