glnemo ChangeLog

V 0.94.2 November 2007
======================
	*) Bugs fixed: 
           -----------
           - Best Zoom works now even if particles have been translated.
           - fix differents bugs regarding to octree partitionning.

V 0.94.1  July 2007
===================
	*) Bugs fixed: 
           -----------
           - application no more crash while displaying a snapshot with different nbodies and velocity
           enable.
           - application no more crash when glnemo is started from the command line with a
           'select_index_list' file in parameter.

V 0.94  June 2007
=================
	*) Input :
	----------
	- it's now possible to give as input an ascii file with a list
	of NEMO snapshots. In such case, the first line of the ascii file
	must be :
	#glnemo_file_list

	- it's now possible to display NEMO snapshots with different
	number of particles. (you need io_nemo >= 1.42)
	
	*) Animation:
	------------

	- it's now possible to save in a file all the events
	(mouse,keyborad) recorded during an animation. You can then reload
	later this file to play the events from another snapshot.

	- on the Animation module, there is a "bench" button which report
	how many frames per second your machine is able to play your
	animation. 

	- new parameters in the command line to play animation and
	benchmark.
	
	*) Octree:	   
	   -------

	- when octree is actived, frustum culling is activated to speed up
	the rendering (a bit buggy btw ....)
	
	*) Bugs fixed: 
           -----------
        - bestzoom now works even if particles are in a small range.

	- zoom option selected from the command line now works.

	- and many many others.
	
V 0.93, September 2006
=============================
	*) features:
	   ---------

	- Velocity vectors display enable for a NEMO snapshot and a
	gyrfalcON simulation. It's possible to control le vectors size
	from the option dialog box (OpenGL tab).

	*) Animation:
	   ---------

	- the option " selected from recording" from the [Options]'s tab
	from Animation dialog box has been fixed. It's now possible to
	record all the OpenGL effects during the animation.


V 0.92, July 2006, (NEMO 3.2.4)
================================
	*) general:
	   --------
	- happy g++ 4.1.x .

	- update OpenGL display to a bigger Depth Of Field (usefull for the 
	  cosmological simulations).
	  
	- fix bug with animation rendering engine when a snapshot reach the end of file.
	
	*) features:
	   --------
	- possibility to display a cube from the grid's options tab

V 0.90, April 2006
===================

	*) Animation:
	   ----------

	- an animation module has been added (click on Camera Icon, or
	press M). From this module you can record/play an animation
	(Record/Play tab). Once recorded, you can render each frames in
	PNG files. Then you can use mencoder to make a movie.

	*) Octree: 
	   -------
	- an Octree engine has been implemented to locate high density
	area. The octree can be activated from Options Dialog
	Box->Experimental Tab. Note that the octree can be itself
	displayed.
	
	*) features : 
           ----------
	- Alpha channel slide added for particles (CF OpenGL tab in Option
	Dialog box)

	- you can specify communication port
	(with gyrfalcON) from connexion server box

	*) Bugs fixed: 
           -----------
	- in options box, grid's buttons and HUD's buttons have the right
	color selected

	- CTRL+A (best fit) works fine if there is no particles.

	- port command line parameter works now 

	- many others fixed

Version 0.87 (December 2005)
============================

	*) general
	   --------

	- all dialog form boxes are now designed with QT designer tool
	(.ui file) which allow a better development.

	- accept snapshot from standard input '-', it allows stuff like:
	mkplummer - 100000 | glnemo -

	- a lot of options from the command line (see glnemo help=h).
  
	- gaz like particle effect (ALT+G) need a powerfull OpenGL video
	card with an accelerated driver (NVIDIA recommended) and not too
	many particles (lower than 30 000) but the effect is VERY nice.

	- possibility to select particles from a list of indexes read from
	a file (option select_list=). It must be an ascii file with the
	following structure:

#p_index_list <---------- MUST be the first line (header file)
index01
index02
...
...
indexXX

	- option to print the OpenGL frame buffer
	
	- valgrind safe.

	- **A LOT** of bugs fixed and new features.

	- New licence: CeCILL V 2.0
	
	*) enhanced option dialog box 
	   ---------------------------

	- added new option dialog box with tab frame.

	- added option frame to enable/disable particles

	- added option frame to enter rotation/translation/zoom value

	- added option frame to modify grid (length, size and color of
	each planar grid)

	- added option frame to enable/disable gaz like particle rendering
	(ALT + G)

	- added embeded smoke texture - added orthographic projection

Version 0.52
==============

22 Decembre 2004:

first public release in NEMO package (ver 3.2.2)
