0) Requirements:
------------------  
  In order to compile glnemo you need Trolltech QT developpement library (qt > 3.0). If
KDE environment is installed in your Linux Box, QT should be there also. If not,
you can get it from here http://www.trolltech.com/download/qt/x11.html .
 You also need a descent video card with a fast opengl driver. Especially NVIDA cards 
are known to have a fast opengl Linux driver.( the program  works fine also in software
 mode with MesaGL library).  Glnemo require NEMO (>= 3.2.2) package to compile, it must
 be installed with its variables environment set. You can get it 
 from here http://bima.astro.umd.edu/nemo/

1) Compilation:
------------------
  Check that you have 'qmake' utility in your path ('qmake' is normally included 
with qt package). Go to 'glnemo' directory and enter the command :

   qmake
then
   make
   
it should take a while to compile, at the end you should have a 'glnemo' binary located in
"PATH/glnemo/bin" directory (bin/glnemo).

2) Installation :
-------------------
 To install 'glnemo' into NEMOBIN path, enter the following command:
 
 make install
