  Here is a brief description about how to use 'glnemo' program.
  
  glnemo is a program with NEMO philosophy. You start the command:
glnemo help=
 and you'll see the command line parameters.
 
But glnemo is also an interactive program, so you can start it without 
command line parameters, just enter : glnemo


  Let's start playing with a 10000 particles plummer:
  
mkplummer p.10k 10000
glnemo p.10k

 glnemo should start and load the snapshot p.10k.  

- To rotate: click left or right mouse boutton and move the
mouse. 
  
- zoom  in/out : use the wheel mouse or press '+' or '-' keys. 

- to translate : CTRL + (left or right) mouse button and move the mouse.

- toggle grid : press g  (or click 'grid' icon)

- toggle options : press o ( or click 'tools' icon)
     a tabbed dialog box appear and you can play with different options:
     
     *) OpenGL TAB
        ----------
        [Particles]
     -> 'enable' check box, turn on/off particles display.
     -> use the slide button to increase/decrease particles size.
     
        [Effects]
     -> 'blending' check box, turn on/off blending color.
     -> 'depth buffer' check box, turn on/off opengl depth buffer.
     
        [Projection]
     -> Projection radio button allow to toggle between perpspective and
        orthographic projection.
        
     *) Transformations TAB
        -------------------   
        [Zoom]
     -> zoom value field: give a value to modify zooming.
     
        [Rotations]
     -> Rotations fields: give values to rotate display around X,Y or Z axis.
     
        [Translations]
     -> translations fields: give values to translate display along X,Y or Z axis.
     
     *) Grids TAB
        ---------
        [Dimension]
     -> Mesh length: give a value to specify the mesh length
     -> # Meshs: give a value to specify the number of meshs    
        
        [Activate Grid Plane]
     -> grids X,Y,Z check box, turn on/off drawing of the grid
        in X plane, Y plane or Z plane. 
     -> for each grids plane, you can click on the color button to change the color
        of the grid.
        
     *) HUD TAB
        -------
        [Head Up Display]

	[Colors]

     *) Experimental TAB
        -----------------
     -> 'gaz like particle' check box, toogle on/off particles to gaz like particles
              if enable it needs a very powerfull OpenGL card and an accelerated driver.
              Do not use more than 30 000 particles.
     -> 'texture' slide, modify the size of the "fake" gaz cloud.
     -> 'texture alpha color' slide, modify the transparency of the "fake" gaz cloud

     
          
- toggle particles range : press r  ( or click 'color' icon)
     a dialog box appear which allow you to change the range of selected 
     particles and their colors (click on the color to change it, and a
     intuitive color dialog box appears to help you to select a new color).

- to reset rotation and translation press CTRL+R (or click 'target' icon).

- to fit all the particles on screen press CTRL + A ( or click 'wire box' icon).

- to take a snapshot : press s  ( or click 'camera' icon).

- to play all the snapshot time steps : press p ( or click 'arrow" icon).

- to toggle fullscreen : press f ( or click 'monitor' icon).

 Notice that all these options can be selected via the interface (click on 
the different icons on the left vertical menu bar).
        
 You can also load a new snapshot from top menu bar :
File -> Open file


 Now imagine that you have a snapshot (mysnapshot) with a disc (range from
0:199999)  and a halo (range from 200000:999999). You can start glnemo
like this :
 glnemo in=mysnapshot select=0:199999,200000:999999

  glnemo will load the snapshot and will give different colors for the 
disc and the halo. You can change these colors when pressing 'r' key. You 
can also select or deselect all the objects (check or uncheck 'visible' 
field in range particles dialog box 'r').

 If there are many time steps in the snapshot, press 'p' (or clik 'arrow' icon) to
 load them successively.
