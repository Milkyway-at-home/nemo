 Glnemo is  an interactive 3D plotting program  , using OpenGL and trolltech 
QT API. It allows to plot in 3D, the positions x,y,z of a NEMO snapshot. You can 
zoom in/out, rotate, scale, translate, save a screenshot, select different particles 
and plot them in different blending colors. It gives you a good information of 
the shape of the snaphot.
