===============

Since September 2004, run-Time Manipulators have been added in Walter
Dehnen's gyrfalcON  simulation program (see $NEMO/usr/dehnen/falcON). 
They are functions (in factC++ classes) that operate on the snapshot
data and are called in gyrfalcON after every complete
blockstep. Run-Time Manipulators are loaded at run-time.
 
 Glnemo manipulator transform gyrfalcON simulation program in a 
glnemo server allowing real time 3D rendering of the running gyrfalcON
simulation via the glnemo program. (see $NEMOSRC/nbody/glnemo). 

 There is almost no speed impact (< 1%) on the running gyrfalcON
simulation while glnemo is connected and is getting data from it. (True only if
gyrfalcON and glnemo are started on a different host).

Compilation :
==============

 to compile the manipulator, you need NEMO version >= 3.2.4. By
default, we use $NEMO/usr/dehnen/falcON compiling treepath, but it can
be changed by modifying 'GYRFALCON' variable in the Makefile.

 - to compile enter:
 make

 - to install:
 make install

 
HOW to use:
===========

 - from the simulation host:
   - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 start gyrfalcON program as usual, and add the following parameter: 
 manipname=glnemo


 - from the glnemo rendering host:
   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 start glnemo program as usual, and add the following parameter:
 server=host_running_gyrfalcON


EXAMPLE :
=========

    we assume that the user have 2 Hosts. On the first one, called
node1, we will run gyrfalcON program, on the other one called node2,
we will run glnemo program. (in case of you only have one host,
gyrfalcON and glnemo will be run on the same machine).

  a) create some initial conditions or use your own.

   mkexpdisk out=disk1 nbody=50000

  b) start gyrfalcON (from node1)
  
   ( !!! gyrfalcON environment MUST be loaded: source $NEMO/usr/dehnen/falcON/falcON_start)

   gyrfalcON in=disk1 out=disk1.out step=100 manipname=glnemo  

  c) start glnemo (from node2)

   glnemo server=node1

   [if you run both gyrfalcON and glnemo on the same box, start glnemo
as following:  glnemo server=localhost]

   you whould see in glnemo's windows, the particles of the running
simulation from node1. In order to get in real time the data of the
simulation, press key 'p' in the glnemo's windows, or click on the
arrow button from the glnemo's GUI.
