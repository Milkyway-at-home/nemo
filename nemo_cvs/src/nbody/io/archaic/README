I'm afraid these functions/include files should not be used anymore.
They are from the NEMO childhood period (1986).

This is 'ls -l' as I saw it on July 7, 1990, when it was moved
into the $NEMO/inc/archaic. To be deleted at some point in the
future.

Problems with:

 newton0:  apparantly new stuff in <snapshot/snapshot.h> and 
	<snapshot/body.h> has macro names that Piet also had. Hence
	we still need <snapshot.h>, which should now be referred to
	as <archaic/snapshot.h>.
