# In Reverse Chronological Order:

====== 12-jan-95  PJT

This directory is a terrible hotchpotch of shell scripts. Some of them
are essential for every installation, (e.g. the cc.* scripts, the
ranlib.* pointers) and copied into $NEMOBIN, others are here that
work almost perfect, but often need some tailoring to make it work
on your site, or change your preferences (e.g. nemoman, nemohelp)
and they are not installed by default into  $NEMOBIN. Others are for
administrative purposes only, and not always well documented.
Slowly I will bring some structure to this directory 


==== nov-90:

if you need new cc or make scripts, call them
	cc.$NEMOHOST
	make.$NEMOHOST
as they can be easier used with the top level makefile in $NEMO:

	make scripts SCRIPTS=cc

Why special versions of 'make' and 'cc'?

Well, on the SUN a special version of cc would suffice, beause
we want the C compiler to also look for default include files
in NEMO (usage of the -I flag) and libraries (-L flag).
However Ultrix does not know the -L flag for cc. Solution:
explicitely name all libraries, instead of through the -l flag.

The special make is really Ultrix specific (of course it also
works on SUN), because environment variables are not passed
to makefiles, so a special make was necessary which does pass
it the NEMOPATH variable.

This now also means that the LIBRARY and INCLUDE environment 
variables become obsolete, and could be discarded.

In the process of doing this I had of course a few not well understood
problems....


The 1st. solution to the cc/make version did not work:

  alias cc /bin/cc -I$NEMOPATH/inc

why, is not clear to me yet. Any program in the makefile will execute 
the csh and should know these aliases; however (even on the SUN) it
seemed not to. [correct: /bin/sh is the default]

So I wrote a shell script:

#	new make
echo New Make;/bin/make NEMOPATH=$NEMOPATH/inc $*

#	new cc
echo New Cc;/bin/cc -I$NEMOPATH/inc $*

but this again did not always all the commands it was supposed to
do. In fact their is a difference between doing it manually and through
the Makefile, as if a buffer was overflown....
 
The thing that eventually seemed to work (on SUN) was:

#	new make
/bin/make NEMOPATH=$NEMOPATH/inc $*

#	new cc
/bin/cc -I$NEMOPATH/inc $*
