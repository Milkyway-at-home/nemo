These 'cc' scripts used to be placed in $NEMOBIN/cc, but  caused too much trouble when
other packages had to be installed, and users were hardcoding NEMO in their environment.

As of version 3.0 with a full implementation of autoconf this feature has been
disabled, although these scripts remain here for posterity.
