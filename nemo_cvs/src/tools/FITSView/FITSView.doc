	FITSView Package
	----------------

	Software to display FITS images on Sun Workstations and Sparcstations
	using the SunView environment. Included in this package are:

	ql    - Quick Look. Display a single grey-scale or pseudo-color image.
	rgb   - Use 3 images as inputs to the red, green and blue guns of
	        an 8-bit display monitor.
	rgb24 - Use 3 images as inputs to the red, green and blue guns of
	        an 24-bit display monitor.
	movie - Display many images as frames of a "movie". Images are 
		grey-scale or pseudocolor on 8-bit monitors and full-color on 24-bit
		monitors.
	
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------


	QL - Quick Look. Display a single FITS image as grey-scale, under
	     the SunView environment.

	Usage: ql zoom filename min max

	ql loads in single FITS image file and displays it as a grey-scale 
	image. If the image is larger than the monitor, ql will add scroll
	bars.  ql can run on monochrome, 8-bit color, and 24-bit color displays.
	
	ql takes the following arguments:

	zoom	 - zoom factor by which image will be expanded 	(integer)

	filename - name of FITS image file to be displayed

	min 	 - value of minimum intensity to be displayed

	max 	 - value of maximum intensity to be displayed 

	If min and max are given as the same value, then the actual minimum
	and maximum intensities of the image will be used.

	Once inside ql, you will see the '>' prompt. The commands available
	are:
		g gamma(.38)    Change display gamma correction
		h hardcopy      generate a postscript hardcopy
		i invert        invert pixels
		p nsteps(128)   Change to pseudo color display
		s l h           Rescale picture
		t TGA           generate a TRUEVISION TGA file (tga.out) from image
		q		quit

	Gamma is used to correct for the non-linearity of the display. 
	The correction to greyscale ramp is of the form:

		ramp[i] = 255*{(i/255)^(gamma)}   (i = 0 to 255)
	
	where a perfect linear monitor would need no correction and
        have a greyscale ramp:

		ramp[i] = i; (i = 0 to 255)
	
	We have found empirically that a value of .38 works well for the 
	standard Sun Workstation Sony monitors. The default gamma is set 
	to this value.

	A PostScript hardcopy is obtained be setting the environment
	variable R_DISPOSE to point to your local printer. This is
	the same environment variable used by the IRAF package. A
	typical definition might be
	
		R_DISPOSE="lpr -Pyour_printer -r -s %s" 
	
	The %s is necessary as this is the conversion format 
	string for the temporary PostScript file ql creates.
	It is useful to invert the pixels before making a
	hardcopy--less work for the printer.

	Pseudocolor can be obtained with the 'p nsteps' command, where
	nsteps is the number of contour levels (up to 256) to divide the
	255 brightness levels of the display into.
	The default is 128. To change back to greyscale, use 'g gamma'.

	RGB - Use three FITS images as input for the Red, Green and Blue guns
	      of the display, under the SunView environment.

	Usage: rgb zoom red_image l1 h1 green_image l2 h2 blue_image l3 h3

	rgb loads in three FITS image files and displays them as a single 
	color image. If the image is larger than the monitor, rgb will add scroll
	bars.  rgb runs only on  8-bit color displays. It uses a special dithering 
	scheme (with two bits of blue, three bits of green, and three bits of red)
	mimic a 24-bit display and fool the eye into seeing a true color image.
	The images must all be the same size.
	
	rgb takes the following arguments:

	zoom	    - zoom factor by which image will be expanded (integer)

	red_image   - name of FITS image file to be displayed in the red 'plane'.

	l1	    - value of minimum intensity to be displayed in the red image.

	h1 	    - value of maximum intensity to be displayed in the red image.

	green_image - name of FITS image file to be displayed in the green 'plane'.

	l2	    - value of minimum intensity to be displayed in the green image.

	h2 	    - value of maximum intensity to be displayed in the green image.

	blue_image  - name of FITS image file to be displayed in the blue 'plane'.

	l3	    - value of minimum intensity to be displayed in the blue image.

	h3 	    - value of maximum intensity to be displayed in the blue image.


	If ln and hn are given as the same value, then the actual minimum
	and maximum intensities of the image will be used.

	Once inside rgb, you will see the '>' prompt. The commands available
	are:
		d n     Load picture n           
		r       show red 'plane' only
		g       show green 'plane' only
		b       show blue 'plane' only
		q       quit

	The correction for the non-linearity of the display is set to .38

	is not-changeable (see documentation for ql).

	      of a 24-bit display, under the SunView environment.

	rgb24 loads in three FITS image files and displays them as a single 
	color image. If the image is larger than the monitor, rgb24 will add scroll
	bars.  rgb24 runs only on  24-bit color displays.

	h2 	    - value of maximum intensity to be displayed in the green image.

	blue_image  - name of FITS image file to be displayed in the blue plane.

	l3	    - value of minimum intensity to be displayed in the blue image.

	h3 	    - value of maximum intensity to be displayed in the blue image.

	If ln and hn are given as the same value, then the actual minimum
	and maximum intensities of the image will be used.

	MOVIE - display FITS astronomical images on Sun Workstations 
       		as frames of a "movie", using the SunView environment.

	Usage: movie npic i zoom filespec [min max]
	
DESCRIPTION:
	
	movie loads in up to 200 FITS images (depending memory available)
	and the user can step through them manually (both forwards and
	backwards) or run a "movie" of the images at a variety of frames
	per second. If the images are larger than the screen, movie will 
	add scroll bars. movie requires the image filenames to conform to the
	following standards: 

		1) all the images for a single "movie" must have
		   the same basename and increasing integer extensions.
	
			e.g., Orion.0, Orion.1, Orion.2, ... Orion.N.
	
		2) The images must all be the same size.

	movie can run on 8-bit color and 24-bit color displays.
	It displays the files as grey-scale, pseudo-color or '3-color' images. 
      	When using 3-color, three adjacent images are loaded into the red, 
	green and blue planes of the display. For instance, if the user is 
	displaying spatial-spatial images and stepping through velocity space 
	in successive images, then adjacent velocity-channel images are shown 
	with the most negative velocity in the blue plane, the middle velocity 
	in the green and the most positive velocity in the red.  On 8-bit
 	monitors a dithering scheme is used to mimic three full color planes 
	(see documentation for 'rgb').
	
	movie takes the following arguments:

	npic     - number of images to be displayed   		(integer)

	filespec - base name of image files
	  e.g., files are filespec.0, filespec.1 filespec.2 ... filespec.N

	i        - number of starting file			(integer)
	  e.g., images displayed will be filespec.i ... filespec.npic

	zoom	 - zoom factor by which image will be expanded 	(integer)

	min 	 - value of minimum intensity to be displayed

	max 	 - value of maximum intensity to be displayed 

	min and max are optional. If they are not given or are given as the
	same value, each image will be scaled using its minimum and 
	maximum intensities. 

NOTE:	
	If you are unsure that your machine has enough memory available to
	show your "movie", then it is best to start up movie with the 
	ampersand (&) command terminator to run it as a background job, as
	your workstation may crash if you ask too much of it. You can then use
	kill(1) to terminate the job with extreme prejudice if you think
	it will crash your machine. 
	
SEE ALSO:
	There is a HELP button on the movie panel if you need more information.
