[ This program gives you interactive line editing similar to tcsh or ksh,
  except that it will run any program as its subprocess, so although you
  don't get to carry the `history' context from program to program, you
  can get fancy editing in programs that don't neccessarily support it.
  Running "ile /bin/csh" is a lot like tcsh, and "ile /bin/sh" is a lot
  like ksh.  I wrote the Makefile.                                 --vix ]
