This is a repost of the LaTeX index processor I posted ages ago.
Thanks to John Renner (adobe!renner@decwrl.dec.com) it now handles
roman numeral page numbering too.  It does not handle upper case
roman numeral page numbering though.  You might want to install the
libraries distributed with it, especially the profile library.  It is
quite useful.  To make it, type "make install".  Don't worry, it
won't actually install anything.
