You want to check Makefile for the definitions of AUDIOPLAYER and AUDIODIR.
By default, the file "movietool.au" in AUDIODIR is played by means of the
program AUDIOPLAYER.  A file play.c from the net has been included as a 
convenient AUDIOPLAYER.  You may use a soft link for "movietool.au" if
you want flexibility in which file to play.  In case your system doesn't
have a speaker, simply comment out the lines defining AUDIOPLAYER and AUDIODIR
in Makefile.

Also check the definitions of BINDIR, MANDIR and MANEXT before you install.

Say "make install", and you are all set.

For testing, you may obtain the raster file sequence that was posted with
Movietool-1.0 from titan.rice.edu.
