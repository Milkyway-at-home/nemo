				TCPpipe
========================================================================

Version 0.2


ABOUT:
------
TCPpipe is a very small program to transfer any kind of data from one
host to another over a network.
To do this, first TCPpipe on one host must listen, then TCPpipe on the
other host can connect. After this the data can be transfered: The
sending TCPpipe reads from standard-input and sends it to the receiving
TCPpipe, which writes to standard-output. This allows to connect two
processes on different machines.

TCPpipe was/is written by Grischa Weberstaedt <epibrator@gmx.net> as a
programming exercise and is published under the GNU General Public
License (see COPYING).


BUGS:
-----
Please report all bugs to <epibrator@gmx.net>!
This also applies to my buggy english in source code and documentation.


COMPILING/INSTALLATION:
-----------------------
Take a look at the file INSTALL.


USAGE EXAMPLES:
---------------
For example you can transfer files without an FTP or HTTP server:
On host A:
tcppipe --listen --port 1100 --send < file-on-A
On host B:
tcppipe --connect --port 1100 --receive host.name.of.A > file-on-B
(The port 1100 is only an example, change the file- and hostnames.)

You could even transfer many files with tar:
tar -cOf file1 file2 dir/* | tcppipe -lp1100
tcppipe -cp1100 192.168.0.5 | tar -xf -

To gzip the data do this:
prog-producing-output | gzip | tcppipe --send ...
tcppipe --receive ... | gunzip | prog-reading-input
