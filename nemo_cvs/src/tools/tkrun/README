tkrun is a tk script generator allows you to build a Tcl/Tk GUI that
executes another program or script. You don't need to learn Tcl/Tk
(although that is still much easier than learning to program a GUI in a
language like C or C++). TkRun is probably most useful if you use sliders,
radio- and checkbuttons and perhaps file browsers. For pure text entry
the speedup you gain in your life is only modest, if not even less.

The receiving program *must* currently conform to the ``keyword=value''
(but probably not too hard to add some ``-option value'' type
interface). In the C-shell this is easily achieved by adding the
following 3-liner to the top of the script:
	foreach a ($*)
	   set $a
	end	

I am submitting this code in the hope it will be tried out and found
useful, but problems and suggestions for improvement be reported for
updates which I am planning.

adass97.ps.gz: a small poster contribution I gave at the annual ADASS
    conference. I represented the status at the 0.1 release.

redo:  Also added is a tiny little tcl/tk script 'redo' that I found in John
    Ousterhout's book that I find quite useful under certain circumstances.
    You can run programs, and keep rerunning them. Cute.

Feel free to redistribute the code (please keep the original copyright
and GPL notice) but I appreciate receiving changed code, particularly
if it is an improvement on my version. 


The latest "x.y" version can be found in 
	ftp://ftp.astro.umd.edu/progs/nemo/tkrun-x.y.tar.gz
or see the NEMO home page at:
	http://www.astro.umd.edu/nemo/

Note: if the tar file version contains the word beta, e.g.
tkrun-0.2beta.tar.gz, the version is just a beta snapshot of
that version, and not final. Use at your own risk.

Note2: sometime in November 2000, I noticed the announcement of a similar
program under Freshmeat, or Linux Applications, and this should be tracked
down..
