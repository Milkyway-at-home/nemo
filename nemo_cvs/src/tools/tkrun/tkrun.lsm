Title:          tkrun - automatic GUI builder and frontend to run shell scripts
Version:        0.2
Entered-date:   2000-nov-25
Description:    This program allows you to build a very simple GUI from some
                tagged comments in a shell script. It does this on-the-fly
		by scanning the shell script, then running wish on this tk 
		script with a GUI that controls subsequent execution (through 
                a ``keyword=value'' type CLI) of the script itself.
		One of the main advantages of running the script this
		way is easy re-execution with different parameters.
		The GUI currently supports the main standard Tk widgets:
		entry (plus tk_getOpenFile, tk_getSaveFile for files), 
		radiobutton, checkbutton, and scale.
