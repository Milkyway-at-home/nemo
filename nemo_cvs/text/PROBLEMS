- on sun4:
   CFLAGS '-Bstatic' needed when loadobj() used, this is for 
   CFLAGS '-Dsun4'   needed for loadobj.c
  
- GCC:
      -fwritable-strings for a lot of things, since we write
	in 'constant' strings. Need a way to explicitely (in ansi
	notation) declare it as variable, such that these things
	wind up in text space, not in data space

	lot of routines have their local (static) routines not declared
	as such at beginnning of file; this generates a lot of warning
	messages.
