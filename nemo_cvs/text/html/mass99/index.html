<h1>NEMO for MASS99 users: RECIPES</h1>

<h2>NEMO environment</h2>

NEMO is a package that modifies your Unix environment a little bit,
in order to use it (e.g. it adds $NEMOBIN to your $PATH), or write
new program in it. Most users will add something like the
following to their .cshrc file:
<pre>
	<B>source /home/nemo/nemo_start</B>
</pre>
If you don't really want it to be part of your default login, just
make an alias to load it on demand instead.

<h2>NEMO programs</h2>

Once NEMO is loaded there will be a lot of programs in $NEMOBIN that
you can execute, either from the command line, or via 'shell' scripts.
Each NEMO program should have a Unix 'man' page. Let's take the 
NEMO command <I>mkplummer</I>, which creates a Plummer sphere or
particles.
<PRE>
  % <B>man mkplummer</B>
MKPLUMMER(1NEMO)                                 MKPLUMMER(1NEMO)



NAME
       mkplummer  - generates a snapshot according to a truncated
       Plummer model

SYNOPSIS
       mkplummer [parameters=values...]

DESCRIPTION
       mkplummer constructs a Plummer model, with  a  spatial  or
       mass  cut-off, after which it performs a coordinate trans-
..

(this also means you can use programs like 'gman' or 'tkman' to
privide GUI based access to the manual pages. At last count we had
well over 250 program man pages, and almost 1000 man pages (programs,
library routines, data file info, etc.) in total.
<P>
In addition, each NEMO program has builtin help (after all, man pages
are written separately from the program code and can 
be out of sync with the executable), which you can get via a
system keyword <B>help</B>:

As you could perhaps see from the <B>help</B> system keyword, program keywords are
used as command line parameters to pass information into the program. They
are either fully specified by <I>keyword=value</I>, or by their position (order)
on the command line. In the latter case the <I>keyword=</I> part can be 
ommited (you will often find the first two or three parameters to be
the obvious ones that make writing command lines quick).
 For example, the follow three examples are identical:
<PRE>
  % <B>mkplummer p10 10</B>
  % <B>mkplummer nbody=10 out=p10</B>
  % <B>mkplummer - 10 > p10</B>
</PRE>
This last example shows a feature of the NEMO user interface that is 
often (ab)used, and that is using Unix pipes. When a filename is designated
by a dash (-), it means it is at the sending or receiving end of a pipe, 
whichever is appropriate. Here is another example:
<PRE>
  % <B>mkplummer - 100 | snapscale - - rscale=1,1,0.1 | snapprint - x,y,z > p10.tab</B>
</PRE>
which takes a Plummer sphere of 100 particles, flattens it by
scaling all Z-coordinates by 0.1, and writing out all X,Y,Z coordinates
to an ASCII file.

<hr>
<h2> Importing and plotting MASS99 data </h2>

Although NEMO can read many snapshot-like formats, the easiest is probably to use
the (ascii) <I>tipsy</I>  format.

<PRE>
   % <B>reduce99 input=isothermal_small.input tipsy=y</B>
</PRE>
which will convert all MASS99 files wih the name outfile.???? to 
ASCII tipsy files named ducky.????.

Next the tipsy data will be converted to the NEMO snapshot format. Some information
will be lost, since this program does not import pure gas properties in
mixed-particle mode.

<PRE>
   % <B>tipsysnap ducky.0001 snap.0001</B>
or
   % <B>zcat ducky.0001.gz | tipsysnap - snap.0001</B>
</PRE>

Next we can do some simple plotting using NEMO's snapplot program:


step3:  plot the distribution, using the yapp= system keyword and the case
where NEMO was compiled with PGPLOT (yapp means Yet Another Plotting Package
and is just an interface to PGPLOT in this case).
<PRE>
  % <B>snapplot snap.0001  xrange=-32:32 yrange=-32:32</B> <A HREF=plot1.gif>plot1</A>
  % <B>snapplot snap.0001  xrange=-32:32 yrange=-32:32 yapp=/vps</B>
  % <B>snapplot snap.0001  xrange=-32:32 yrange=-32:32 yapp=snap.0001.gif/vgif</B>
</PRE>
As you can see, the first galaxy was centered at the origin, the second one
was offset a little bit. Probably in velocity too:
<PRE>
  % <B>snapplot snap.0001  xrange=-32:32 yrange=-4:4 yvar=vx</B> <A HREF=plot2.gif>plot2</A>
</PRE>

To visualize the 3D structure interactively, a crude program xyzview was written a long
time ago, and it needs data in a simpler <I>xyz</I> format. So, before viewing, the snapshot
is transformed into yet another format....:
<PRE>
  % <B>snapxyz snap.0001 xyz.0001</B>
  % <B>xyzview xyz.0001 scale=32</B>  <A HREF=plot3.gif>plot3</A>
</PRE>
When the image comes up, you can use hold the '1', '2' or '3' keys, while moviing the mouse
and resp. rotate, zoom or add velocity vectors to the image. Also note that as soon as you
started interactive work, only a subset of the particles (nfast=2048 by default) is displayed.
The ESC key will exit the window.
<p>
This is not a very interesting plot, as all three components are colored boring red. Luckily
snapxyz can add colors to the particles, and like most NEMO programs, handles arbitrary
expressions containing body variables. For example, color=1 is red, color=2 yellow, color=3 green
we will paint the dark particles red, the gas particles yellow, and the star (i.e. disk) particles
green.
<PRE>
  % <B>rm snap.001.xyz</B>
  % <B> snapxyz snap.0001 xyz.0001 color='i<4000?2:i<12000?1:3' </B>
  % <B> tsf xyz.0001 allline=t item=Color | more </B>
  % <B> xyzview xyz.0001 scale=32 nfast=20000 </B>  <A HREF=plot4.gif>plot4</A>
</PRE>
surely a much more interesting view.

<h3>Ingredients of the 'mass.input' file</h3>

This galaxy is made within the default [-1,+1] unit coordinates.
We can specify various properties of it as given below.

<h4>Our Specific Galaxy Sizes</h4>
<li><b>TEST_NUMBER = 30000</b>, number of particles in sim
<li><b>TEST_CASE = galaxy_disk</b>, i.e. make a galaxy, or <b>INPUT_FILE = data.0000</b>, using an already-created galaxy.  More on this in a bit.

<h4>Basic Galaxy Physics</h4>

<h4>Model Details</h4>
<li><b>RESET_USER_PARAMETERS = no</b>, set to 'no' to ensure we pick up proper values above
<li><b>DO_QUAD = yes</b>, use quad trees for calculations (faster)
<li><b>DO_EXACT = no</b>, no need to exactly calculate forces
<li><b>EPSILON = 0.015</b>, gravity softening length
<li><b>NTREES = 2</b>, allows for both gravity and SPH gas
<li><b>ENERGY_TOL =    0.1000000000000000</b>, sets our worst-case energy violation limit
<li><b>DAMPING_COEFFICIENT = 0.0d0</b>, velocity damping to allow relaxation towards equilibrium
<li><b>LIS_RATIO = 3.0d0</b>, lowered isothermal sphere ratio
<li><b>ALPHA1 = 0.8d0</b>, <b>ALPHA2 = 0.8d0</b>, <b>ALPHA3 = 0.5d0</b>, gravitional courant numbers
<li><b>TEST_DISTRIBUTION = random_distribution</b>, ensures random models when doing multiple galaxies


<h4>Duration of Run</h4>
The sim will run until it does 'max_steps' at at least 'timestep_floor' or
it reaches 'time_stop'.  Thus the minimum run duration is the minimum
of 'time_stop' or 'max_steps*timestep_floor'.  The maximum run duration
is 'max_steps*timestep_ceiling', with a likeliest duration of 'max_steps*delta_t' or 'time_stop', whichever happens first.

<li><b>MAX_STEPS = 500</b>, how many steps to run
<li><b>TIME_STOP  = 32.d0</b>, how long to run sim in units of 'unit time'
<li><b>DELTA_T    = 0.001</b>
<li><b>TIMESTEP_FLOOR = 0.0d0</b>
<li><b>TIMESTEP_CEILING = 0.05d0</b>

<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
<li> create a directory under the 'RUN' hierarchy for this
<li> make one galaxy with mass99 and mass.input
<li> make another with mass99 and mass.input
<li> resize Galaxy B to fractional mass, offset position, initial velocity
<li> combine Galaxy B' and Galaxy A, and check if it looks right
<li> run with new mass.input that calls file, not test case
</ol>

<h4>Create a directory under the 'RUN' hierarchy for this</h4>

And, make sure to create an initial 'mass.input' using the <em>Ingredients</em> list given above to overright the default values.  All other default parameters can be left as is, or tweaked to try different settings.

<h4>Make one galaxy with mass99 and mass.input</h4>

We use our initial choice of N particles (e.g. 30000).  The "LIS3" model
creates a unit-mass, unit-sized disk galaxy.
<p>
Make sure you specify "TEST_CASE = galaxy_disk" in the 'mass.input' file, and not an "INPUT_FILE".  Set "MAX_STEPS = 1" so it simply creates, then ends.
<p>
Then, run "../create99".  Once it stops, you should have a file 'data.0000' which contains your first galaxy.  Move this to a new name (suggested, 'target.0000').
 
<h4>Make another with mass99 and mass.input</h4>

Simply run "../create99" again, so it makes a new 'data.0000' galaxy file.  You can rename this (suggested, 'galaxyB.0000').  If you plan for this projectile
galaxy to be significantly smaller than our first target galaxy, you may
want to reduce its number of constituant particles.  To do this, just
edit "mass.input" and set <b>TEST_NUMBER = 30000</b> to some smaller
value.

<h4>Resize Galaxy B to fractional mass, offset position, initial velocity</h4>

This will be our 'projectile', while Galaxy A is presumed to be the 'target', simply for nomenclature purposes.
<p>
You want to make our second galaxy (which initially is pretty similar to our target galaxy) be of an appropriate mass.  This can be 'the same mass', producing a collision of equal mass galaxies.  Or, you can make it smaller, for a typical Cartwheel-like collision.
<p>
We also need to give to move Galaxy B away from our Galaxy A, and give it
an initial velocity towards Galaxy A (so they will collide).
<p>
All of this is done in one pass with the "../scale99" routine.  As this routine
uses the 'mass.input' file, you need to comment out "TEST_CASE = galaxy_disk" and write in "INPUT_FILE = galaxyB.0000".  [Future updates will manually
ask for a file name, since otherwise this gets ridiculous trying to track
these things.]
<p>
Now run "../scale99", and answer the questions as given below.  For our coordinate scheme, the galaxies initially are created with the disk along the X-Y plane and scale heights along the Z axis.
<p>
In this recipe, we want to 'lift' Galaxy B up in 'Z' so that it will travel along the axis (roughly) of Galaxy A, impacting near the center of Galaxy A.  We also want to give Galaxy B some non-perpendicular orientation to add variety.
<ol>
<li>For "Euler rotation", choose a set of Euler angles so that you can get the desired impact positions.  Suggested is <b>0 90 0</b>, a rotation of the projectile Galaxy B to be edge-on to Galaxy A's center.  That 90 degree angle can be arbitrarily set to any orientation desired.
<li>For "Lateral shift", we need to move Galaxy B some distance away.  We'll use a sample distance of 10 (unit lengths) away in Z, with a small shift of 0.1 units in X, zero in Y.  Thus we enter <b>0.1 0 10</b>.
<li>Apply a "Velocity vector" so the two will collide during the simulation
time.  This depends on your simulation time versus time step and your given problem.  Galaxies colliding rapidly are distinct from those which 'fall' together from the 10-unit-spacing distance.  For now, let's give it a nominal "0.1" Z-velocity component (so, even if there was no gravity, they would collide within 100 unit time steps).  We'll skip side motions of the projectile for now.
So enter <b>0 0 0.1</b>.
<li>For "Change mass", now we can adjust the projectile galaxy's size-- and thus total mass.  This so far has defaulted to '1 unit mass').  For equal masses between 'projectile' and 'target', just set this to <b>0</b>.  For a 1/10th mass projectile, set this to <b>0.1</b>.
<li>For "Recenter or leave as positioned", enter <b>0</b>-- we don't want to recenter to the galaxy's center of mass, because that would eliminate our spatial and velocity shifts!
<li>For "number of input files to merge", enter <b>0</b>: we're just dealing with our projectile galaxy here.
</ol>
<p>
From this, our Galaxy B becomes projectile galaxy B', saved as file 'data.0000'.  Rename 'data.0000' to some better name, such as 'projectile.0000'.

It is ready to hit the target.  Now we need to add the target and the projectile into one file.

<h4>Combine Galaxy B' and Galaxy A</b>

Again, we call up "../scale999".  This time, we answer <b>0 0 0</b> for the
first four rescaling questions (i.e. no change).  Then answer <b>1</b>
for the recentering question-- we do want to recenter our combined
system after we merge them.

<p>
Now enter <b>2</b> for "Number of Input files
to merge", and give (when promoted) their file names: <b>target.0000</b> and
<b>projectile.0000</b>.  (This will bypass any input file names in the
'mass.input' file so no changes need to be done to that file here.)
<p>
This writes out 'data.0000', which you can now rename to 'collision.0000'.
We now have a single data file for our collision!  Run the "../reduce99"
routine to create a set of projection files at 0,0 and 0,90 degrees to
verify that the two galaxies are properly scaled and positioned.

<h4>Run with new mass.input that calls file, not test case</h4>

We are ready to do our simulation.  Edit "mass.input" to set:
<ol>
<li><b>INPUT_FILE = collision.0000</b>
<li><b>MAX_STEPS = 500</b> (since we reset this to '1' earlier).
</ol>

<p>
Now run "../mass.input" and it will do your simulations.  Your
original 'collision.0000' file will remain untouched by this,
so you can alter parameters and do multiple runs safely.
