This directory contains manuals:

	Makefile	aid in making (la)tex based manuals
	README		this file	
	*.tex		main latex files
	*.inc		latex include files
	*.src		latex verbatim file to be included by \verbatim
	*.sty		latex style files 
				(currently nemo.sty absorbes all style mods)



they still use the old-style latex. A more modern approach would be


- Use pdflatex instead of latex (most people want a pdf as output anyway)
- Convert ps/eps file to pdf
- include it using \includegraphics[foo]  (note the lack of extension)
