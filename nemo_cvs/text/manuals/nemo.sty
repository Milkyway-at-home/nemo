% NEMO.STY -- a proposed uniform document style option for Miriad Manuals
% Use with:
% \documentstyle[nemo]{report}


% History:
%    7-mar-91	Created	- Peter Teuben
%   21-mar-91   played with marginpar`s - sigh		PJT
%   21-jun-91   toyed with adding more header/footer	PJT
%   21-jul-93   added verbatimfiles.sty from tex listserver		pjt


%
%  I coulnd't get this too work either - PJT 
%\newenvironment{example}{\footnotesize\begin{verbatim}}
%	{\end{verbatim}\normalsize}


%
% I really seem to have a hard time with latex these days, this
% command below also failed in some instances. It seems if some
% of these \marginpar's are too close, Latex will find irecoverable
% errors.  - PJT
\def\mymargin#1{\marginpar{\small \tt #1}}	% place arg in \tt in margin

% Common abbreviations:
%
\newcommand{\eg}{{\em e.g.}}            % e.g.
\newcommand{\ie}{{\em i.e.}}            % i.e.
\newcommand{\etc}{{\em etc.}}           % etc.
\newcommand{\vs}{{\em vs.}}             % vs.
\newcommand{\usec}{{$\mu$}sec}          % microseconds

% Here is a version of Adrian's VERBATIM.STY, for inputting whole files
% verbatim, which is "more LaTeX-like" in that it uses the actual LaTeX
% macros which set up the `verbatim' environment.
%
% As a matter  of interest, it is much nicer for TeX if you input large
% quantities of "verbatim material" from an "external file" rather than by use
% of the `verbatim' environment (i.e. putting the material in the main input
% file. This is because this environment, in common with most (but not all)
% other "verbatim macros", makes the whole of the "vebatim material" a macro
% argument and therefore eats up TeTeX's internal memory.

%
% --- This LaTeX style-file defines two user-callable macros:
% ---     \verbatimfile{<filename>}    for verbatim inclusion of a file
% ---     \verbatimlisting{<filename>} for verbatim inclusion with line numbers
%
% --- The macros are based on those distributed with Sunil Podar's
% --- `EPIC.STY' macro package, attributed to Tim Morgan,
% --- modified to keep internal macros internal by Adrian F. Clark,
% --- alien@uk.ac.essex.ese
% --- ---and further latexification by Chris Rowley,
% --- ca_rowley@uk.ac.open.acs.vax.
%
% --- Note that the precise layout of line breaks in this file is important!
