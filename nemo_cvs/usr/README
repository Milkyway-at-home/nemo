This directory contains contributed software which has a much looser connection
to NEMO. Installation is sometimes integrated, but without any formal rules.
The $NEMO/src tree is more controlled in how routines and programs get compiled.

Portability within the $NEMO/usr tree is not as well maintained as in the $NEMO/src
tree.
