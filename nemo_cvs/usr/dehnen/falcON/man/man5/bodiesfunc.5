.TH bodyfunc 5falcON "12 July 2006"

.SH Name
bodiesfunc expression \- used in generating \fIbodiesfunc(1falcON)\fP
functions: functions taking a set of bodies, time and a set of
parameters and returning bool, int, real, or vector.

.SH Description
\fIbodiesfunc\fP expression are valid C (in fact C++) expressions that
evaluate to either a bool, an integer, a real, or a vector.  On
construction of a \fIbodiesfunc\fP, the C++ compiler is
employed to to generate on the fly (as the user runs the program) the
function together with type information and information on which body
data are required, see \fIbodiesfunc(1falcON)\fP.

.SH List of valid subexpressions
The bodiesfunc expression may contain the following subexpressions
.sp 2

.ta \w'vtimes'u+14n +\w'vtimes.3c'u+2n
\fIName\fP	 \fIType\fP      \fIDescription\fP
.sp 5p
\fB constants and global properties\fP
Pi	r	3.14159265358979323846264338328
N	i	\fBN\fP, the total number of bodies
M	r	\fBM\fP, the total mass
t	r	\fBt\fP, the time of the snapshot
\fB operators\fP
Sum{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	i,r,v	\fBsum\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Mean{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	i,r,v	\fBmean\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Mmean{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	i,r,v	\fBmass-weighted mean\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Max{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	i,r,v	\fBmax\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Min{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	i,r,v	\fBmin\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
And{\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	b	\fBAND\fP of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Or {\fIexpr\fP@\fIcond\fP}	b	\fBOR\fP  of \fIexpr\fP over bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
Num{\fIcond\fP}	i		\fBNumber\fP of bodies satisfying \fIcond\fP
.fi

Note that \fBMean{\fP\fIX\fP\fB}\fP is equivalent to (but more efficient
than) \fBSum{\fP\fIX\fP\fB}/N\fP. Similarly, \fBMmean{\fP\fIX\fP\fB}\fP is
equivalent to \fBSum{m*\fP\fIX\fP\fB}/M\fP.

.SH Operations and functions
The subexpression arguments \fIcond\fP and \fIexpr\fP to the operators
can be bodiesfunc expressions mixed with \fIbodyfunc(5falcON)\fP
expressions. \fIcond\fP is defined as the part after the separator '\fB@\fP'
and constitutes a condition for a body to be considered. If the argument of the
operator contains no '\fB@\fP', the condition is omitted (all bodies are
considered). The condition is converted to bool: non boolean conditions are
considered true if non-zero.
.sp
In addition, the expression may use any standard mathematical
expressions, including math functions. For vectors, all operations
defined for tupel<3,real>, see \fItupel(5falcON)\fP, are allowed.
The following lists some of these and additional functions supported.
.sp 2
.nf
.ta \w'vtimes'u+8n +\w'vtimes.3c'u+2n
\fIName\fP	\fIType\fP	\fIDescription\fP
vector*vector	real		returns the scalar product
vector^vector	vector		returns the vector cross product
vector(x)	vector		converts scalar to vector
real(x)	real		converts integer to real
norm(x)				returns x*x for any type
abs(vector)	real		returns sqrt(norm(vector))
abs(real)	real		returns |real|
max(x,y)	scalar		returns the greater of two scalars
max(vector)	real		returns the greatest vector element		
min(x,y)	scalar		returns the smaller of two scalars
min(vector)	real		returns the smallest vector element		
.sp 5p

.SH Examples
The following lists some example \fIbodiesfunc\fP expressions:
.sp
	\fBM\fP and \fBSum{m}\fP
.br
both evaluate the total mass of all bodies;
.sp
	\fBMin{eps}\fP and \fBMin{eps@r>#0}\fP
.br
evaluate the mininum softening length of, respectively, all bodies and
of all bodies with radius larger than parameter 0;
.sp
	\fBSum{m@E<0}\fP and \fB0.5*Sum{m*norm(vel)@E<0}\fP
.br
evaluate, respectively, the mass and the kinetic energy of all bound
bodies;
.sp
	\fBNum{r<Min{eps}}\fP and \fBSum{1@r<Min{eps}}\fP
.br
both evaluate the number of bodies with radius less than the minimum
softening length (this demonstrates the usage of another bodiesfunc
expression inside a bodiesfunc operator);
.sp
	\fBSum{l*m}/M\fP, \fBMean{l*m}/Mean{m}\fP and \fBMmean{l}\fP
.br
are three ways to evaluate the mass-weighted mean of specific angular momentum.
