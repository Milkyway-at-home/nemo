To vtc (Vectorizable Treecode written in C) users...

1) To compile the code, choose an appropriate makefile from the
follwing list:

    Makefile.linux:    for Linux
    Makefile.solaris:  for SUN Solaris
    Makefile.tru64:    for COMPAQ Tru64
    Makefile.vpp5k:    for Fujitsu UXP/V on VPP5000

and modify Makefile.XXX so that it would suit your environment. Then
type

    make -f Makefile.XXX

This will generate executable 'vtc' and library 'libvtc.a'. Here
'Makefile.XXX' denotes the makefile you have chosen. 'XXX' other than
'linux' may not be up to date. If you have trouble during compilation,
you may want to modify the 'Makefile.XXX' consulting 'Makefile.linux'.

2a) To use 'vtc' executable, run 'vtc' with '-h' option. You will see
a brief description for option switches.

2b) To use 'libvtc.a' library, include 'vtc.h' into your code before
linking 'libvtc.a'. The function prototypes are defined in it.
