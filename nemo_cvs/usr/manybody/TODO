the list of problems:


FC4:
  - starcluster:  may need -lqt-mt instead of -lqt
  - glstarview: needs packages GL, GLU and freeglut
  - may need to force gfortran for starlab, but nemo doesn't
    like it


nemo:
  - FC4: conservative linking (3 tests fail)
  - MDK8: plotting programs hanging during testsuite?

starlab:
  - FC4: problems in harpsims for strict ansi?
  - MDK10: no configure?
  - MDK8: why does it use --without-qt

partiview:
  - OSX10.3: no support via our procedure, need binaries?
