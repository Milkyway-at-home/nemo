Hi Peter, 

I am sending you an alpha version the code written by me and Tjeerd. I
have cleaned the source files from specific diagnostic stuff that I
used for my research. I left the basic diagnostic quantities,
e.g. total energy, angular momentum, inertia tensor, density and
anisotropy profiles, plus the original fort.2 file used in old Tjeerds
code which summarizes the most important information. 

I was hoping to be able to do more to prepare the code interfaced for
NEMO, but time is runnng so fast that it is probably better if I send
you this stand-alone version. Next Wednesday we can thus discuss what
changes I can make to the source code for the distribution.

To compile simply use: 

make -f Makefile

To test that all is working you may then try to execute "CGS". I have
set up the init files so that a Plummer model with 40000 particles is
integrated for a couple of dynamical times using a radial grid with
N_g = 80 and including spherical harmonics up to l=4. 

The total energy and angular momentum conservation may be checked from
fort.20 (see below). 

Input: 

* PARAMETER.DAT controls the basic input (the template provided
  contains explanation of each entry line) With PLUMMER INIT FLAG = 1
  you generate a plummer model, with FLAG = 2 you start from clumpy
  init conditions (some more things to be set in this case) while with
  FLAG = 3 you read the ICs from the files "initPOS.dat" and
  "initVEL.dat".

Output files: 

* fort.2: van Albada's output (you may be already familiar with it...) 

* fort.11 & fort.12: several lagrangian radii vs time 

* fort.13: radial and tangential velocity dispersions; at each output
  time it gives for each grid point r, <v_r^2(r)>, <v_t^2(r)>,
  <v_t^2(r)>/<v_r^2(r)>

* fort.14: total radial and tangential kinetic energy: time, K_r,K_t, 2K_r/K_t

* fort.16: inertia tensor eigenvalues vs. time 

* fort.17: ellipticity ratios b/a and c/a vs. time with a >= b >= c

* fort.18: density computed over the radial grid at each output
  time. For each line: radius, density (using PIC kernel), Mass(r),
  density (using simple number count), number of particles in the grid.

* fort.19: time, angular momentum components, and mean shape parameter
  $e$ of the orbits (for definition of $e$ you may look in the source
  code). 

* fort.20: time, total energy, virial ratio -2K/W, total angular
  momentum

* fort.28, fort.33, fort.34 same as fort.18, fort.13 and fort.14 but
  using only bound particles. 

If you have any question please contact me!

Best regards,

Michele
