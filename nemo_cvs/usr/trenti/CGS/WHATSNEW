Michele Trenti: 22 March 2006

* I have modified writesnap() to call diagnostic:
    -  now the velocities in the snapshot are syncronized with
       positions by taking a half a timestep with the leapfrog
    -  in addition the snapshot contains the forces and the
       potential
* I have also introduced two arrays xCMstore(3) & vCMstore(3)
  to keep track of Center of Mass adjustments, so that the snapshot is
  now written in the initial reference frame (this feature seems OK,
  but more testing would be nice... guess that it will be easier once
  we have the snapshots in NEMO format)
