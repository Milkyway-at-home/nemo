# Makefile for vogl (On non SGI-GL machines, if you are on an SGI and
# plan to use the real GL (as opposed to X11 on an SGI), then use the 
# Makefile.sgi as this will only compile the Hershey library and the examples)
#
# Usage: make
#
# As well as selecting the devices, you may have to change LLIBS and MLIBS 
# as well (see below).

# Some machines use /bin/csh in Make (or use the envionment variable
# SHELL. We want to us /bin/sh.

#  The devices you wish to have compiled into the library and the
#  location of the object files for each device relative to the 
#  src directory. For each device defined there should be a 
#  corresponding ../drivers/file.o in the DOBJS line.
#
#  Possible DEVICES and their object files are:
#		-DPOSTSCRIPT	../drivers/ps.o
#		-DHPGL		../drivers/hpdxy.o
